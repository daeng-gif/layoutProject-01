          <p class="header__container__small">
            “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
            the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
            others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
            aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror,
            and all have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock,
            disgust.

            Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
            Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
            recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

                The 2010s was such an incredible decade for first-time directors
                in the horror genre. Jennifer Kent with The Babadook (2014);
                David Robert Mitchell with It Follows (2014); Robert Eggers with
                The Witch (2015); S. Craig Zahler with Bone Tomahawk (2015);
                Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz with Goodnight Mommy (2015);
                and Ari Aster with Hereditary (2018). Somehow shaking the
                sophomore slump that so many creative people are cursed with,
                these filmmakers were able to rally and release something just
                as good as (and sometimes better than) their first outing. With
                Midsommar, Ari Aster tossed most of the horror tropes we’ve
                grown so tired of out the window (he was never really a
                subscriber anyway). Midsommar takes place primarily in the
                bright light of day, and all murders occur offscreen. We only
                get to see the aftermath, and it isn’t pretty. He starts the
                film with an illustration that, if studied closely, reveals the
                entire story he’s about to tell. The visual tone of the film is
                very bright and washed-out, which makes the moments of violence
                all the more shocking and disturbing. Blood has never looked so…
                bloody. Once again, Ari has filled his film with an assortment
                of easter eggs and subliminal clues, none of which are required
                to enjoy the film but make the experience all the more
                engrossing. I can’t explain why, but while Hereditary was
                definitely the bleaker film, I walked away from Midsommar
                feeling… ickier. I really believe this is due in large part to
                the stark contrast between the visual style of the film and the
                violence. When something terrible does happen, the camera
                doesn’t shy away. There are no quick, apologetic shots of gore.
                When the man leaps from the cliff and lands on his feet, we get
                a clear, personal, up-close view of the aftermath, and boy is
                that a striking visual. Like so many others, I cannot wait to
                see what else Ari Aster has to share with us.

                I wish I could remember how I stumbled upon They Look Like
                People, but I’m so glad I did. It’s a subtle, understated
                psychological thriller that relies entirely on good writing,
                good performances, and the viewer’s imagination. There is very
                little in the way of special effects, save for some truly
                inspired sound design, but director Perry Blackshear does a
                wonderful job of facilitating the viewer in filling in those
                blanks ourselves. Is Wyatt crazy? Or has he really seen
                something he wasn’t supposed to see?

                Director David Bruckner made headlines in the film world when he
                released his first film, The Signal (2007), which was made on a
                paltry $50,000 budget. A few years later he would be invited to
                film a segment for the first entry in the V/H/S (2012) series.
                Now four films into that series, his segment, titled Amateur
                Night, is still universally considered one of the best segments
                of the bunch. With The Ritual, we once again see him making
                magic with an incredibly meager budget, this time topping about
                $1,000,000. That’s a remarkable feat, especially considering the
                quality of the final product. This film features above-par
                acting from every cast member, great direction, is visually
                stunning with some pretty convincing set design, and lots of
                effectively eerie shots of the forest that gives it a foreboding
                life of its own. Strong recommend.
